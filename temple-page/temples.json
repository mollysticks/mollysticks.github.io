The historic flooding in Southeast Texas created by Hurricane Harvey breached the Houston Texas Temple on August 26, 2017, resulting in significant damage. The baptistry flooded to the top, and water reached waist deep in some areas of the basement. Several inches of water on the main floor ruined carpet and furniture. The temple was temporarily closed for repairs.",

The evening before the temple dedication, 20,000 people filled the Alamodome for a cultural celebration, featuring fireworks, horses, and over 4,000 singers and dancers. The various presentations reflected on Texas history, patriotism, the importance of family values, and the story of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In promoting the celebration, producer Gary Bradley noted, 'It'll make people proud, and some parts of it will make people cry.' Two hours before the musical celebration began, President Gordon B. Hinckley delighted the audience with a speech focused on the temple.",
